# Finger.Farm Advanced Finger Hosting
https://finger.farm

Your Dad fingered your Mom in the 90s.

Originally conceived as a way to get a status report someone or something, the Finger Protocol aka RFC-742, has been around since the late 70s. Even today, the capability to finger lies dormant in every major OS.

Once upon a time, you could finger your boss, finger a vending machines, finger the weather, finger John Carmack, etc... Users would share .project and .plan files, showing their current project and plans. The original telepresence. The original Internet of Things. The original microblogging.

Although it's fallen out of fashion, finger still works and still has a valid purpose. Finger.Farm breaths new life into an ancient protocol, bringing the advanced finger features and finger functions into the future.
